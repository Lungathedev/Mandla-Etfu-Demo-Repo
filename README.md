> This is the demonstrational github repository for the [mandlaetfu](https://mandlaetfu.org.za/Home.php) website application.


## ⭐️ Purpose

This website application was built for the Mandla Etfu NPO which is a nonprofit organization based in South Africa that was incorporated to create jobs through the cannabis industry. Essentially the nonporfit organization collects donated cannabis from cannabis cultivators and then gives the cannabis away for free to adult cannabis users through the [kannabae](https://kannabae.org.za/Port.php) platform. By giving away free cannabis to users through the [kannabae](https://kannabae.org.za/Port.php) platform, the organization creates jobs and fulfills it's objectives. The [mandlaetfu](https://mandlaetfu.org.za/Home.php) website application helps market the nonprofit organization to the public as well as serves as a tool that people can use to make donations to the organization.
